This is a reserach project I did where I combined Generative Adversarial Networks with Model Agnostic Meta Learning to create a sort of curriculum learning. 
The GAN generates mazes scaling in difficulty with the MAML agent's performance. 
This results in training that is more efficient than a standard implementation, and maybe in the future similar techniques could be used for practical purposes?


Claude code definitely help me debug a lot
